This is a .NET/Blazor application and uses the standard configuration file mechanism (appSettings.json) and its environments mechanism configuring different environments. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments?view=aspnetcore-6.0.

Optionally, set the environment variable ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to a value of ‘Development’ to show debug information on the Process page, otherwise leave blank.
